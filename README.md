 Program Purpose "Serial Terminal Free V21.2
This program is needed to work through the serial port. I work as an electronic engineer. I have to use a lot of different types of equipment, sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, network converters, meters, registrars, etc. For the adjustment and maintenance of equipment and various protocols, it is also necessary to use various programs. For work, I developed a convenient software "Serial Terminal V21.2", "for myself."

 Program Purpose "Serial Terminal Free V21.2
This program is needed to work through the serial port.  For the adjustment and maintenance of equipment and various protocols, it is also necessary to use various programs. For work, I developed a convenient software "Serial Terminal V21.2", "for myself." 
Perhaps, at the future, PCs will contain a huge number of ports and they will exchange data at at higher speeds...

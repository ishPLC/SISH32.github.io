	<center><h3> Program Purpose "Serial Terminal Free V21.2" </h3>
	This program is needed to works through the serial port. 
	<br> </br>
	"Serial Terminal Free Version V21.2" is a small program written in C ++ that is needed for express test equipment, including the popular Arduino PLC.
Basic protocol settings: 9600, 8, N, 1. The port number can be selected in the Serial Terminal program, based on which port your PLC is currently connected to.
	<br> </br>
You can go to the PC in the Device Manager - Ports (COM & LPT) and look at which COM port your device is connected to (COM1). (It is possible to use additional utilities to determine the com port.)

	<br> </br>
	In Arduino PLC, you must use the port setting:
	<br> </br>
	void setup () {
	<br> </br>
    <h3>Serial.begin(9600); // Serial  (9600, 8, N, 1)</h3>
	<br> </br>
	//..... code ....
	<br> </br>
	}
	<br> </br>
	To output data, for example, reading the value of analog input A0, and outputting this value for transmission to the serial port, you can use the code:
	<br> </br>
	int sensorValue0 = analogRead(A0);
	<br> </br>
	Serial.print(sensorValue0);
	<br> </br>
	(Many of the Arduino PLC programs can be found on the Arduino website and other network resources.)
	<br> </br>
	<center><h2>Work in the program "Serial Terminal":</h2>	
	<br> </br>1. In the "Port #" position, select the number of the active com port (1).
	<br> </br>2. Click the "Connect Serial" button. If all the settings are made correctly, then data will be sent to your PC from the connected PLC. 
	<br> </br>
	<center><h2>"Features of the program Serial Terminal"</h2>
	<br> </br>
	1. zoom (++) and zoom (-) are buttons for increasing or decreasing the program’s working window, including the font. 
	<br> </br>
	2. "Receiving Data Indicator" - LED that lights when receiving data from the PLC.
	<br> </br>
	3. The bottom right will show the selected port number and port settings.
	<br> </br>
	

	The program is very reliable, simple and easy to use. I recommend using this version for equipment testing: PC - PLC (Arduino for example), etc.
	<br> </br>
	I tested it many times in different modes, and made the program "for myself".
